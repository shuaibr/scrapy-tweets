was only by retrospect you could be made aware of the amazing variety of ideas that had been presented mr clare certainly found few men in this remote situation that were capable of participating in his ideas and amusements it has been among the weaknesses of great men to fly to solitude and converse with woods and groves rather than with a circle of strong and comprehensive minds like their own from the moment of mr falkland s arrival in the neighbourhood mr clare distinguished him in the most flattering manner to so penetrating a genius there was no need of long experience and patient observation to discover the merits and defects of any character that presented itself the materials of his judgment had long since been accumulated and at the close of so illustrious a life he might almost be said to see through nature at a glance what wonder that he took some interest in a mind in a certain degree congenial with his own but to mr tyrrel s diseased imagination every distinction bestowed on his neighbour seemed to be expressly intended as an insult to him on the other hand mr clare though gentle and benevolent in his remonstrances to a degree that made the taking offence impossible was by no means parsimonious of praise or slow to make use of the deference that was paid him for the purpose of procuring justice to merit it happened at one of those public meetings at which mr falkland and mr tyrrel were present that the conversation in one of the most numerous sets into which the company was broken turned upon the poetical talents of the former a lady who was present and was distinguished for the acuteness of her understanding said she had been favoured with a sight of a poem he had just written entitled an ode to the genius of chivalry which appeared to her of exquisite merit the curiosity of the company was immediately excited and the lady added she had a copy in her pocket which was much at their service provided its being thus produced would not be disagreeable to the author the whole circle immediately entreated mr falkland to comply with their wishes and mr clare who was one of the company enforced their petition nothing gave this gentleman so much pleasure as to have an opportunity of witnessing and doing justice to the exhibition of intellectual excellence mr falkland had no false modesty or affectation and therefore readily yielded his consent mr tyrrel accidentally sat at the extremity of this circle it cannot be supposed that the turn the conversation had taken was by any means agreeable to him he appeared to wish to withdraw himself but there seemed to be some unknown power that as it were by enchantment retained him in his place and made him consent to drink to the dregs the bitter potion which envy had prepared for him the poem was read to the rest of the company by mr clare whose elocution was scarcely inferior to his other accomplishments simplicity discrimination and energy constantly attended him in the act of reading and it is not easy to conceive a more refined delight than fell to the lot of those who had the good fortune to be his auditors the beauties of mr falkland s poem were accordingly exhibited with every advantage the successive passions of the author were communicated to the hearer what was impetuous and what was solemn were delivered with a responsive feeling and a flowing and unlaboured tone the pictures conjured up by the creative fancy of the poet were placed full to view at one time overwhelming the soul with superstitious awe and at another transporting it with luxuriant beauty the character of the hearers upon this occasion has already been described they were for the most part plain unlettered and of little refinement poetry in general they read when read at all from the mere force of imitation and with few sensations of pleasure but this poem had a peculiar vein of glowing inspiration this very poem would probably have been seen by many of them with little effect but the accents of mr clare carried it home to the heart he ended and as the countenances of his auditors had before sympathised with the passions of the composition so now they emulated each other in declaring their approbation their sensations were of a sort to which they were little accustomed one spoke and another followed by a sort of uncontrollable impulse and the rude and broken manner of their commendations rendered them the more singular and remarkable but what was least to be endured was the behaviour of mr clare he returned the manuscript to the lady from whom he had received it and then addressing mr falkland said with emphasis and animation ha this is as it should be it is of the right stamp i have seen too many hard essays strained from the labour of a pedant and pastoral ditties distressed in lack of a meaning they are such as you sir that we want do not forget however that the muse was not given to add refinements to idleness but for the highest and most invaluable purposes act up to the magnitude of your destiny a moment after mr clare quitted his seat and with mr falkland and two or three more withdrew as soon as they were gone mr tyrrel edged further into the circle he had sat silent so long that he seemed ready to burst with gall and indignation mighty pretty verses said he half talking to himself and not addressing any particular person why ay the verses are well enough damnation i should like to know what a ship load of such stuff is good for why surely said the lady who had introduced mr falkland s ode on the present occasion you must allow that poetry is an
he immediately penetrated the cause and observed that my very countenance told him he was no longer a welcome guest to me i asked him if he ought so to be since his motives for seeking admission were unworthy of being communicated to my friends that he said was not the case but that prudence in the present instance required a temporary concealment he then undertook to exculpate himself from blame assuring me that as soon as i should discountenance the expectations of mr boyer and discontinue the reception of his address his intentions should be made known he was enlarging upon this topic when we heard a footstep approaching us and looking up saw mr boyer within a few paces of the arbor confusion seized us both we rose involuntarily from our seats but were mute as statues he spoke not a word but casting a look of indignant accusation at me a glance which penetrated my very soul turned on his heel and walked hastily back to the house i stood a few moments considering what course to take though shame and regret had almost taken from me the power of thought major sanford took my hand i withdrew it from him i must leave you said i where will you go said he i will go and try to retrieve my character it has suffered greatly by this fatal interview he threw himself at my feet and exclaimed leave me not eliza i conjure you not to leave me let me go now i rejoined or i bid you farewell forever i flew precipitately by him and went into the parlor where i found mr boyer and my mamma the one traversing the room in the greatest agitation the other in a flood of tears their appearance affected me and i wept like an infant when i had a little recovered myself i begged him to sit down he answered no i then told him that however unjustifiable my conduct might appear perhaps i might explain it to his satisfaction if he would hear me that my motives were innocent though they doubtless wore the aspect of criminality in his view he sternly replied that no palliation could avail that my motives were sufficiently notorious he accused me of treating him ill of rendering him the dupe of coquetting artifice of having an intrigue with major sanford and declared his determination to leave me forever as unworthy of his regard and incapable of love gratitude or honor there was too much reason in support of his accusations for me to gainsay them had his impetuosity suffered me to attempt it but in truth i had no inclination to self defence my natural vivacity had forsaken me and i listened without interrupting him to the fluency of reproachful language which his resentment inspired he took a very solemn and affectionate leave of my mamma thanking her for her politeness and wishing her much future felicity he attempted to address me i suppose somewhat in the same way but his sensibility somewhat overcame him and he only took my hand and bowing in silence departed the want of rest for two long nights together the exercise of mind and conflict of passions which now tortured my breast were too much for me to support when i saw that he was gone that he had actually forsaken me i fainted my mamma with the assistance of the maid soon restored me when i opened my eyes and beheld this amiable and tender parent watching and attending me with the most anxious concern without one reproachful word without one accusing look my reflections upon the part i had acted in defeating her benevolent wishes were exquisitely afflictive but we mutually forbore to mention the occasion of my illness and i complied with her advice to take some refreshment and retire to my chamber i am so much fatigued by the exertions of the day that rest is absolutely necessary and i lay aside my pen to seek it friday morning when i shall again receive the balmy influence of sleep i know not it has absolutely forsaken me at present i have had a most restless night every awakening idea presented itself to my imagination whether i had sustained a real loss in mr boyer s departure reflections on my own misconduct with the censure of my friends and the ill natured remarks of my enemies excited the most painful anxiety in my mind i am going down but how shall i see my mamma to her i will confess my faults in her maternal breast repose my cares and by her friendly advice regulate my conduct had i done this before i might have escaped this trouble and saved both her and myself many distressing emotions friday evening i have had a long conversation with my mamma which has greatly relieved my mind she has soothed me with the most endearing tenderness mr atkins with whom mr boyer lodged while in town called here this afternoon i did not see him but he told my mamma that mr boyer had returned home and left a letter for me which he had promised to convey with his own hand by this i am convinced that the die is absolutely cast with respect to him and that no attempts on my part to bring about a reconciliation would be either prudent or successful he has penetrated the cause of my proceedings and such is his resentment that i am inclined not much to regret his avoiding another interview my excuses would be deemed utterly insufficient and truth would not befriend and justify me as i know you are impatient to hear from me i will now despatch this long letter without any other addition than that i am your sincere friend eliza wharton letter xlii to mr charles deighton hartford well charles the show is over as we yankees say and the
time to be visible only by fits this token of approaching land affected me as much as if i had reached the threshhold of my friend s dwelling at length we entered the port and i viewed with high raised but inexplicable feelings objects with which i had been from infancy familiar the flag staff erected on the battery recalled to my imagination the pleasures of the evening and morning walks which i had taken on that spot with the lost constantia the dream was fondly cherished that the figure which i saw loitering along the terrace was her s on disembarking i gazed at every female passenger in hope that it was she whom i sought an absence of three years had obliterated from my memory none of the images which attended me on my departure chapter xxiv after a night of repose rather than of sleep i began the search after my friend i went to the house which the dudleys formerly inhabited and which had been the asylum of my infancy it was now occupied by strangers by whom no account could be given of its former tenants i obtained directions to the owner of the house he was equally unable to satisfy my curiosity the purchase had been made at a public sale and terms had been settled not with dudley but with the sheriff it is needless to say that the history of craig s imposture and its consequences were confirmed by every one who resided at that period in new york the dudleys were well remembered and their disappearance immediately after their fall had been generally noticed but whither they had retired was a problem which no one was able to solve this evasion was strange by what motives the dudleys were induced to change their ancient abode could be vaguely guessed my friend s grandfather was a native of the west indies descendants of the same stock still resided in tobago they might be affluent and to them it was possible that mr dudley in this change of fortune had betaken himself for relief this was a mournful expedient since it would raise a barrier between my friend and myself scarcely to be surmounted constantia s mother was stolen by mr dudley from a convent at amiens there were no affinities therefore to draw them to france her grandmother was a native of baltimore of a family of some note by name ridgeley this family might still exist and have either afforded an asylum to the dudleys or at least be apprised of their destiny it was obvious to conclude that they no longer existed within the precincts of new york a journey to baltimore was the next expedient this journey was made in the depth of winter and by the speediest conveyance i made no more than a day s sojourn in philadelphia the epidemic by which that city had been lately ravaged i had not heard of till my arrival in america its devastations were then painted to my fancy in the most formidable colours a few months only had elapsed since its extinction and i expected to see numerous marks of misery and dispopulation to my no small surprize however no vestiges of this calamity were to be discerned all houses were open all streets thronged and all faces thoughtless or busy the arts and the amusements of life seemed as sedulously cultivated as ever little did i then think what had been and what at that moment was the condition of my friend i stopt for the sake of respite from fatigue and did not therefore pass much time in the streets perhaps had i walked seasonably abroad we might have encountered each other and thus have saved ourselves from a thousand anxieties at baltimore i made myself known without the formality of introduction to the ridgeleys they acknowledged their relationship to mr dudley but professed absolute ignorance of his fate indirect intercourse only had been maintained formerly by dudley with his mother s kindred they had heard of his misfortune a twelvemonth after it happened but what measures had been subsequently pursued their kinsman had not thought proper to inform them the failure of this expedient almost bereft me of hope neither my own imagination nor the ridgeleys could suggest any new mode by which my purpose was likely to be accomplished to leave america without obtaining the end of my visit could not be thought of without agony and yet the continuance of my stay promised me no relief from my uncertainties on this theme i ruminated without ceasing i recalled every conversation and incident of former times and sought in them a clue by which my present conjectures might be guided one night immersed alone in my chamber my thoughts were thus employed my train of meditation was on this occasion new from the review of particulars from which no satisfaction had hitherto been gained i passed to a vague and comprehensive retrospect mr dudley s early life his profession of a painter his zeal in this pursuit and his reluctance to quit it were remembered would he not revert to this profession when other means of subsistence were gone it is true similar obstacles with those which had formerly occasioned his resort to a different path existed at present and no painter of his name was to be found in philadelphia baltimore or new york but would it not occur to him that the patronage denied to his skill by the frugal and unpolished habits of his countrymen might with more probability of success be sought from the opulence and luxury of london nay had he not once affirmed in my hearing that if he ever were reduced to poverty this was the method he would pursue this conjecture was too bewitching to be easily dismissed every new reflection augmented its force i was suddenly raised by it from the deepest melancholy to the region
taken it for a knob on the bark of the tree all three now returned to watch the manoeuvres of the birds that not having seen them by the nest still continued playing among the flowers the boys stole as near as possible keeping behind a large bunch of hanging vines lucien was nearest and his face was within a few feet of the little creatures so that he could observe every motion they made he was soon gratified with a sight that determined his point for him a swarm of small blue winged flies attracted his attention they were among the blossoms sometimes resting upon them and sometimes flitting about from one to another he saw the birds several times dash at them with open bills and pick them from their perch so the question was decided the humming birds were insect eaters after a while the female flew off to her nest leaving the male still among the flowers the curiosity of the boys was now satisfied and they were about to return to the tent when lucien suddenly made a motion whispering the others to remain silent francois first caught sight of the object which had caused this behaviour on the part of his brother and then basil saw it a hideous object it was crouching among the leaves now crawling sideways now making short springs and then hiding itself went a fearful looking creature it was about the size of one of the birds but far different in appearance its body consisted of two pieces joined about the middle and covered all over with a reddish brown wool or hair that stood upright like bristles it had ten limbs long crooked and covered with hair like the body two curved claw like antennae or feelers in front and two horns projecting behind so that but for the sharp fiery eyes of the creature it would have been difficult to tell its head from its hinder part its rusty colour its ill shaped body and hairy legs combined with the piercing look from its eyes gave it a most vicious appearance such as belongs less or more to all of its race for it was of the race aranea or spiders the leaping tarantula whispered lucien to his brothers see he continued it is after the ruby throat this was evident step by step and leap after leap it was approaching the cluster of blossoms where the humming bird was at the moment engaged its eyes were bent eagerly upon the latter and whenever it flew up from the flowers and whirred idly about the tarantula squatted itself closely hiding behind the leaves or shanks of the vines on the other hand when the bird settled a moment and appeared busily feeding the skulking creature would advance a stage nearer either by a quick run or a leap when it would again conceal itself and await a fresh opportunity as the bird flitted about a good deal the spider had frequently to change its direction in following the former after one of its short flights settled into a pet flower directly in front of where the latter lay crouching it did not enter the cup of the flower but remained at the mouth poised upon its whirring wings while with its long prehensile tongue it drew out the honey it had scarcely been a moment in this position when the tarantula sprang forward and clutched it round the body with his antennae the bird with a wild chirrup like that of a distressed cricket flew outward and upwards its wings were still free and all expected it would carry off the spider that was now seen clinging around it not so however on getting a few feet from the flower its flight appeared to be suddenly checked and although it still kept in the air flying first one way and then another it was evident that something restrained it from getting clear off on looking more attentively a fine silk like line was seen stretching from the trees to the fluttering creature it was the thread of the spider and this it was that prevented his victim from carrying him into the air the little wings soon ceased to move and both bird and spider fell to the end of the thread where they hung for a moment suspended the boys could see that the bird was dead and the mandibles of the tarantula were buried in its shining threat francois would have rushed forward to kill the destroyer but lucien who was too ardent a naturalist to have his lesson thus interrupted restrained his more impetuous brother and all three remained quiet as before the tarantula now commenced reeling in his line for the purpose of carrying his prey up among the branches where he had his nest the boys looked upward to discover the latter there sure enough was the web in a shaded corner stretching its meshes from a large liana to the trunk of the tupelo and towards this point the spider now slowly progressed with his lifeless victim as they watched his motions their eyes were caught by a shining object that moved along the wrinkled bark of the liana as the vine was nearly a foot in diameter and of a deep ferruginous colour this object was the more apparent against its dark ground for it was a creature of brilliant hues it was an animal of the lizard species and if any lizard could be considered beautiful this one might have been so called but the hideous half human form of these animals their piercing looks their stealthy and predatory habits and above all the knowledge that the bite of several of their species is poisonous combine to render them objects that excite disgust and awe rather than admiration this one as we have already said was of the most brilliant colour the whole of its upper surface was a
mr sheldon laughed at first at the whim she had conceived and endeavoured to rally her out of it but finding that it was to her a matter of serious importance and thinking there could be neither harm nor impropriety in granting her request he acceded to her wishes and she was ever after called dorcasina about two years after this a circumstance happened which formed an important era in the life of miss dorcasina mr sheldon one day received a letter from an old esteemed friend in virginia whom he had not seen for fifteen years informing him of his intention of making him a visit adding that he should bring with him his only son the stay and prop of his declining age and the darling of his fondest affections lysander by which name we shall cull the young gentlemen was about twenty five his person was noble and commanding his countenance open and liberal and his address manly and pleasing his understanding was rather solid than brilliant and much improved by education and travel his ideas of domestic happiness were just and rational and he judged from what he had observed that an agreeable matrimonial connexion was much the happiest state in life he therefore wished to marry but there happened to be no lady in the circle of his acquaintance who perfectly both satisfied his judgment and pleased his fancy miss dorcasina on perusing the letter handed by her father thought the time wag now come when she should experience the sweet satisfaction of loving and being loved the similarity of their circumstances lysander am only son and she an only daughter the old gentleman s coming so far to see her father his never having done it before and his bringing his son with him all served to confirm her in the opinion that he was the person decreed by the stars to become her husband she would to be sure have been better pleased had their acquaintance commenced in a more romantic manner she wished that in passing by his carriage had broken down and he had been brought in wounded or that he had accidentally met her scouring the woods on horseback an amusement in which she took great delight and that her horse being unruly he had arrived just in time to save her from falling or which would have been still more to her taste that some resolute fellow in love with her to distraction but who had made no impression on her heart had carried her off by force to marry her and that lysander had rescued her by his gallantry and conveyed her back in safety to the arms of her distressed parent but as none of these romantic adventures with which she had been so delighted in novels had ever happened to her she thought she must be satisfied if at their first interview he beheld her with raptures of delight and of this she entertained not a shadow of doubt the night previous to the day on which with alternate emotions of hope fear and pleasure she expected the arrival of lysander she returned at her usual hour to her chamber attended by a female domestic who having been brought up in the family from seven years old had become her confidante and favourite this she considered indispensible for it would have been entirely out of character and setting aside a most essential circumstance in the life of a heroine not to have had either a friend to whom she could confide the secret of her love or a maid who could be bribed by an enamorato to place a letter in her way and then confidentially assert that she knew not from whence it came both these characters are frequently united in the same person as was the case in the present instance for there being no female among her acquaintance in the neighbourhood whose notions of love were so refined or if you please so romantic as were those of miss dorcnsina she declined all intimacy with them and preferred betty to the double capacity of servant and confidante betty was a few years older than her mistress she was a good hearted honest creature possessed of a tolerably good natural understanding but very ignorant and extremely superstitious after dorcasina had disposed herself in bed she requested betty to sit down by her bedside saying she had something of consequence to communicate betty having seated herself in an attentive posture dorcasiha began by informing her that it was impressed on her mind that she and the young gentleman who was next day expected should at first sight fall violently in love with each other and that she had not the least doubt but he was the person destined by heaven to become her husband betty remaining silent for indeed she was at a loss for a reply dorcasina thus continued though i know that love is stronger than death and that with a beloved object a person may be happy on the top of the alleganies or among the snows of greenland yet i must confess i shall feel a sensible pain at quitting my dear and affectionate father and this delightful spot where i have passed all my life and to which i feel the strongest attachment but what gives me the greatest pain is that i shall be obliged to live in virginia he served by slaves arid be supported by the sweat toil and blood of that unfortunate and miserable part of mankind perhaps ma am said betty lysander and his father treat their slaves well and they live comfortable and happy comfortable they may be replied dorcasina but slavery and happiness are in my opinion totally incompatible disguise thyself as thou wilt still slavery thou art a bitter pill they complain of the idle thievish unfaithful disposition of their slaves but let the proprietors in their turn be degraded to servitude

his loquacious conductor entertained him on the road with a description of his peggy and her family and leander though he smiled at his simplicity could not but admire his disinterested generosity and warm benevolence these were qualities of the heart and under whatever form they were exhibited were worthy of admiration the carriage at length stopped at the door of the cottage leander s heart bounded with expectation as he stepped over the threshold in a moment he found himself in the presence of his amelia they rushed to each other s arms and those who have felt the keen rapture of a safe return can only imagine the feelings of two fond hearts glowing with undivided affection amelia soon recollected herself and rapidly withdrew her hand what dow this mean exclaimed he oh my amelia when

cheered her desponding spirits by representing in lively colours the joy of her parents on seeing her return we must pass over in silence the scene of their interview parental and filial affection

impetuosity of a torrent might indeed be overwhelmed but not rent asunder three days intervened and the lovers had no interview in the hour of misfortune when oppressed with a multiplicity of thoughts to disburthen the mind either by writing or conversation gives relief to pain and transquillity to the unquiet borne down with sorrowing reflections ira took the determination of communicating his thoughts to isabella the unfortunate bride was sitting heavy melancholy musing twas at the decline of day the parting sun shot a horizontal beam through the crimson curtains ira entered and beheld in the person of his beloved the figure of patience on a monument as described by shakespeare smiling at grief he took her hand she looked up arose my husband my brother the young man agitated by a thousand sensations grew gradually composed isabella i must see you no more how are my senses bewildered in this meeting i find even now that to meet your eye is at once my pleasure and my perdition why do i suppress my feelings why check the tears which involuntarily burst from my eyes peace ira peace give liberty to your sensations to act themselves why dam up the streams of thy tears are they not the characteristicks of nature to designate an honest heart to remain in your presence my sister my wife is willingly to swim into the vortex of destruction i have imposed upon myself a resolve therefore to see you no more convinced that absence from you will conduce to my welfare isabella manifested evident symptoms of dislike at this resolution will you fly and suffer me to sink into the gulf of despair for never more shall i appear in the world if uncomforted uncountenanced unsupported by you no matter by what title i call you still are you my stay and my staff the young husband imagined he proceeded systematically let us be ruled by reason in all distress mankind imbibe consolation from two sources in dissipation is sought a temporary forgetfulness but experience evinces there is no lethe for love in time or absence we trust for relief but how vain the hope of future repose i will strike a blow at the root i will depart with all imaginable expedition i will seek redress in the bosom of the mercantile world busied with novelty and engaged in regular pursuits i will teach my mind to contemplate other objects and to forget the image of isabella which has so long possest my heart and obtruded itself into every action of my life perhaps my future conduct may be tinged with the melancholy of this adventure i will yet remember you with respect what is more with tenderness a new era is commenced in the history of my life i am no more what i was hitherto i have conceived of human nature a character which it is a duty to wear now i read them as they are and feel myself a better man a better citizen though less philanthropick regarding myself i shall be rich and be capacitated to fulfil those offices of tenderness and charity which i have heretofore only known in theory for one favourable circumstance i pay my gratitude to the bounty of heaven the discovery and termination of an unfortunate passion has not sunk me to that stupid apathy which absorbs the senses but has inspired me with that resolution which is the soul of action doomed to look on you only in the light and to call you only by the appellation of sister reminded by every object of the calamitous event of our loves i go lorenzo in the ardour of friendship provides my passage and i am forthwith to embark isabella viewed the project of her friend with pity and a smile which indicated her contempt of its practicability your forced pretended resolution my dear ira is of little consequence i know your character ira better than you know it yourself honest sincere impetuous yet meek and candid i can conceive how far you may be driven by the strength of passion how far deluded by the well intended but wrong headed advice of friendship do you love and yet think to forget one by mixing with the world of business impossible personal presence is not necessary to inspire or continue love we love those whom we have never seen or from whom we are removed by absence the characters of the great and the good picture to us ideas of beauty and beauty is the cause of love how are we struck with the awful virtue of a brutus or a cato how delighted with the more gentle more amiable graces of a scipio how do we exult in the honest heart and unambitious mind of a cincinnatus a la fayette and a washington to come up to our times still nearer how are our breasts warmed with sympathetick benevolence at the name of howard do we not figure to ourselves in the solemnity of sacred anticipation the son of heaven seated at the right of the throne of grace extending the hand of welcome to the disciple of charity and pronouncing with the voice of applause i was in prison and you came unto me we love those whom we have not seen because we entertain in our hearts an idea of beauty caused by their virtues surely therefore if you are possessed of such an idea it will follow you to the uttermost parts of the earth haunted continually with the ideal presence of the beloved object you will change your climate but not your mind remembering me is the retrospect painful matters it in what place you take this retrospect better be here though surrounded with disappointment and solemn thought than among strangers let the mind be employed but do not go ira perceived in the argument of isabella that sublime which not only persuades but transports he owned
a word not used by any english prose writer of eminence until the reign of george the third nor ever introduced into a serious poem until adopted by cowper a word which if we may judge of adjectives as we do of men by their associates shows the baseness of its origin by the company it keeps being generally coupled with fellow a term i conceive of no respect except in courts and colleges englishmen from the peer to the peasant cannot converse ten minutes without introducing this pert adjunct the english do not however use it in the same sense we do in new england where we apply it to personal grace and call a trim well built young man clever which signification is sanctioned by bailey s and the elder english dictionaries nor do they use it in our secondary sense when applying it to the qualities of the mind we intend by it good humoured they use it to signify skilful adroit and the man who breaks a dwelling house a prison or a neck adroitly is clever i heard a reverend prebend in company with several clergymen of the episcopal church after having magnified the genius of the prelate pronounce the archbishop of canterbury a very clever fellow a native of england may be distinguished as readily by the frequent use of the adjective clever as the native of new england by that of the verb guess it was not until i had been some months in london that i discovered how often i exposed myself to ridicule by the repeated use of this verb my new friend b of the inner temple who has a profound knowledge of every subject but the law as he is one of those assiduous benchers described by pope who pens a sonnet when he should engross pointed out to me this provincialism as he styled it what is the reason he inquired that you new englandmen are always guessing i replied coolly because we imagine it makes us appear very clever fellows now here to my astonishment b was in the same predicament as myself although he had repeated clever and clever fellow perhaps twenty times in this interview he had not noticed it he was a gentleman of too refined a taste to advocate this alsatia term but would hardly be persuaded of its exuberant use until i had drawn his attention to it in conversation with several of his countrymen and was at length obliged to send him half a sheet of extracts in prose and verse to convince him of its absurd recurrence in the modern english fine writing but b is really a clever fellow learned and candid terms seldom united by a london copula and we agreed to assist each other in devesting our style of these silly colloquisms soon after b said to me with earnestness now you have read boswell you must acknowledge dr johnson to have been a very clever fellow i guess he was i replied if however i should be requested to note some shibboleth to distinguish an old from a new englandman it would not belike the israelites in pronunciation nor yet in expression or accent not in words but in mode an englishman puts and answers a question directly a new englandman puts his questions circuitously and ways answers a question by asking another i am indebted in some measure to b for this distinction who in early life spent a winter in hartford connecticut but which your own observations even in boston will abundantly confirm when my friend the templar first noticed this local peculiarity i was inclined to dispute its universality among us b offered to risk the decision of our dispute upon the reply of the first new englandman we should chance to accost and as an englishman who is opposed to you in argument always has abet or a blow at your service he offered a small wager that he would propose a direct question to him and the yankey should reply by asking another we were strolling in st james s park and who should approach very opportunely butcharles of salem after the first salutations b said pray mr what time of the day is it by your watch why i ca nt say what o clock is it by yours this was followed by a hearty laugh but when the affair was explained to charles he insisted it was merely fortuitous and might not happen again in a thousand instances and finally when b in the pride of victory offered to double the bet and repeat the experiment he took him up b said select your man but here comes your countryman dr you will allow him to be as correct a speaker as any in new england all shall be fair i will put the question in such a way as shall preclude the possibility of his being taken by surprise charles acknowledged dr was the very man he would have selected the doctor by this time joined our party pray doctor said b very deliberately what is the reason you new englandmen always reply to a question by asking another why is that the case sir as you are a very clever fellow and i guess you are wearied by this time i will conclude my letter lest you should not be in a humour to say that s a good one letter xxxiii literary larceny forgery and swindling chatterton ireland and macpherson london my excellent friend in our simple country whenever you hear theft or forgery mentioned you are immediately impressed with the idea of some low fellow stealing a horse or with burroughs issuing his canada bank bills but here in this sublime metropolis where every virtue and every vice is carried to a refined extreme are rogues found who can steal the cardinal virtues and forge counterfeit immortality horace might boast that his name was too
delivered a package of letters to my uncle from my father the carriage with one servant the driver had returned from the chesapeak to connecticut my father had but one brother and two sisters of which my uncle here is the youngest one of my aunts the old maid who was my protectress at the old mansion you have seen at my father s the other was the mother of alfred she married very young to a gentleman in hartford of the name of wilmot who fell before the walls of louisburg in the old french war my aunt did not long survive him her health which had been for some time declining received so serious a shock by this catastrophe that she died a few months after the melancholy tidings arrived leaving alfred their only child then an infant to the protection of his relations who as soon as he arrived at a suitable age placed him at school my grandfather who had the principal management of mr wilmot s estate sent my uncle who was then young and unmarried to hartford for the purpose of transacting the necessary business here he became acquainted with a young lady eminent for beauty and loveliness but without fortune the daughter of a poor mechanic as soon as my grandfather was informed of this attachment he in a very peremptory manner ordered my uncle to break off the connection on pain of his highest displeasure but such is the force of early impressions melissa sighed that my uncle found it impossible to submit to these firm injunctions a clandestine marriage ensued and my grandfather s maledictions in consequence the union was however soon dissolved my uncle s wife died in about twelve months after their marriage and soon after the birth of the first child which was a daughter inconsolable and comfortless my uncle put the child out to nurse and travelled to the south after wandering about for some time he took up his residence in charleston where he amassed a splendid fortune he finally married to an amiable and respectable woman whose tenderness though it did not entirely remove yet greatly alleviated the pangs of early sorrow and this added to the little blandishments of a young family fixed him in a state of more contentedness than he once ever expected to see his daughter by his first wife when she became of proper age was sent to a respectable boarding school in boston where she remained until within about two years before i came here alfred was educated at harvard college as soon as he had graduated he came here on my uncle s request and has since remained in his family soon after i arrived here my uncle came into my chamber one day melissa said he i find by your father s letters that he considers you to have formed an improper connection i wish you to give me a true statement of the matter and if any thing can be done to reconcile you to your father you may depend upon my assistance i have seen some troubles in this way myself in my early days perhaps my counsel may be of some service i immediately gave a correct account of every particular circumstance from the time of my first acquaintance with you until my arrival at this house he sat some time silent and then told me that my father he believed had drawn the worst side of the picture and that he had urged him to exert every means in his power to reclaim me to obedience that beauman was to follow me in a few months and that if i still refused to yield him my hand my father positively and solemnly declared that he would discard me forever and strenuously enjoined it upon him to do the same i well know my brother s temper continued my uncle the case is difficult but something must be done i will immediately write to your father desiring him not to proceed too rashly in the mean time we must consider what measures to pursue you must not my niece you must not be sacrificed so saying he left me highly consoled that instead of a tyrant i had found a friend in my new protector alfred was made acquainted with the affair and many were the plans projected for my benefit and abandoned as indefeasible till an event happened which called forth all the fortitude of my uncle to support it and operated in the end to free me from persecution my uncle s daughter by his first wife was of a very delicate and sickly constitution and her health evidently decreasing after she came to this place she was sent to a village on one of the high hills of pedee where she remained a considerable time she then went to one of the inland towns in north carolina from whence she had but just returned with alfred when i arrived afterwards i accompanied her to georgetown and other places attended by her father so that she was little more known in charleston than myself but all answered no purpose to the restoration of her health a confirmed hectic carried her off in the bloom of youth i was but a few months older than she her name was melissa a name which a pious grandmother had borne and was therefore retained in the family our similarity of age and in some measure of appearance our being so little known in charleston and our names being the same suggested to alfred the idea of imposing on my father by passing off my cousin s death as my own this would at least deter beauman from prosecuting his intended journey to charleston it would also give time for farther deliberation and might so operate on my father s feelings as to soften that obduracy of temper which deeply disquieted himself and others and thus
with a man who had given her such evident proofs of indifference and selfishness but i tremble for her she knows not the world into which she is about to plunge open sincere and without disguise herself she suspects not deceit in others this is a disposition most liable to imposition of any in the world and where joined to great sensibility is the source of undescribable anguish to the possessor i have made some particular inquiries concerning this mrs bellamy with whom sarah is about to embark for an another kingdom i cannot reconcile the idea to myself that a tract of ocean will divide us that in distress or sickness i cannot fly to her that contrary winds may detain her letters even should she write on all occasions but even this she will not promise i will inform you of my health said she but i shall not plague you with all the little cross incidents which may occur while i am acting in my double capacity of humble toad eater to grandmamma and madam governante to little darling you flattered me in your last with the hope of my seeing you in london it will i assure you be a very high gratification but as you mention january for the time of your proposed visit i fear sarah will long ere that have been the inhabitant of our sister island for some weeks as she thinks of departing the latter end of october anne letter xx sarah to anne london jan a most delectable voyage and journey i have had bad weather bad accommodations in the packet bad roads and bad tempered folks to deal with now is not this a bad beginning well there is an old adage which says a good beginning often makes a bad ending and why not vice versa we were six days crossing the channel the wind blew tempestuously and two or three times i thought we should have been obliged to revisit the coast of wales whether we chose it or not and that not in the pleasantest manner imaginable however here we are all difficulties of wind and weather over quietly set down in a very respectable lodging in one of the most public streets in dublin this mrs bellamy is a very different woman on this side st george s channel to what she was on the other and to deal plainly had i known as much before i left england as i do now i should never have thrown myself on her protection but as i am here i will remain a few months i have no great prediliction for another voyage though ever so short during the season when the winds let loose lash the mad billows until they foam and rise threatening even heaven itself indeed my dear there is no scene that ever i witnessed before to be compared to the sublimely terrific grandeur of a storm at sea the horizon contracted by the black impending clouds the angry scud flitting with rapidity through the sky the liquid mountains rising to the topmast heads and from their summit pouring with tremendous roar the white torrent that as it falls threatens to whelm in its abyss the fragile bark as the gloom of night approaches to see on the leeward quarter the black coast o er hung with precipices and fenced around with rocks over which the rude surge incessant breaks to hear the wind howl through the rigging of the laboring vessel which scarce can bear the smallest spread of sail then to reflect that perhaps before the morn returns the vessel crew all all may be enshrouded in a watery tomb no one can have an idea of the sensation that must at such a period prevade the mind even of the most thoughtless unless they have themselves been present at such a scene and to me it seems an impossibility that any one who had once been in such a situation could ever disbelieve the existence of a god great wise powerful and merciful who that has once contemplated his wisdom and his power on the world of waters would wish to disbelieve or for one single moment encourage a doubt but i beg your pardon anne that after having got you safe to dublin i have hurried you back to make you pass a stormy night at sea with a dangerous coast on your lee but as you have escaped shipwreck you may even come quietly again to dublin and setting down by my elbow in a little room up two pair of stairs which is but superior to a closet in a very small degree the furniture of which consists of a half tester bed a deal table a small iron grate that will hold a handful of fire and two rush bottom chairs now is not the apartment most elegant come sit down and be quiet and i will tell you all about madam bellamy and her fair daughter madam o donnel and her sweet pretty peevish petulant perverse grand daughter miss caroline o donnel the old dame does not want ideas in her head nor language to express those ideas but she is one of the most changeable capricious beings that nature ever formed her manners have been formed upon the scale of high life and she certainly has in early days sacrificed to the graces for even now she can converse with condescending affability every word accompanied by a fassinating smile she can be cheerful even to volability persuasion will hang upon her tongue and the genius of taste wit and elegance preside in her apartment but see her two hours after you will not know her for the same woman her brow will lour her large black eyes will flash malignity the demon of spite and slander take possession of her tongue and her language will be such as almost the lowest female would blush
should sternly insist that the work has none of the three great requisites a beginning a middle and an end the author has obligingly fixed the beginning at the first page and the end at the last leaving every one to place the middle where it best suits him or the learned critic may make a beginning by reading only a few pages and an end by frowning the whole work at once into oblivion whereby two out of the three requisites will certainly be produced in short the learned author in imitation of high authorities solicits the indulgence of the public with regard to the appearance of our common uncle sam although he is old enough to be very whimsical he is like the author a green character on the stage he will occasionally make his appearance on various parts of it bouncing like a sturgeon sinking out of sight and soon after thundering out at a distant part now if any one should be so impertinent as to enquire how he travelled some of our novel readers would be the most proper persons to solve the difficulty it will be ob served that another hand besides the professed author s has fingered occasionally in the work this with the discerning will form no objection of this character will be the next chapter the learned ancestors of mine uncle zachary are well known to the hebrew public and although the author at first resolved to have no mosaic work in the splendid structure yet it occurred to him that variety ever has its attractions and it is well known that stanhold and hopkin s translated psalms in company having said this the author submits himself to the acutely censorious allowing them to use the birchen rod whenever they can find him chapter ii some account of thomas the magician and it came to pass fell out or happened somewhat before the time at which our history begins that there arose a mighty man in the land called thomas the magician on account of his great skill and cunning in dark and mysterious projects this man when in his full strength was a mighty man of valor and withal very tender hearted insomuch that in the first notable quarrel between john bull and uncle sam he betook himself to a huge cavern lest his great strength and valor might do overmuch violence to his enemies here he studied magic necromancy and all the curious arts that serve to make a man great in the eyes of the multitude this thomas was moreover of a religious turn of mind for whereas uncle sam acknowledged only one god thomas professed to believe in twenty or none as occasion required whence it came to pass that the multitude for the space of many years cried out great is thomas the magician and it fell out that in process of time thomas fixed his eye on the chief steward ship for thus he reasoned with himself behold now the multitude of the people crieth after me and although george who is now chief steward is greatly beloved by the people yet he now governeth the household of samuel by a new covenant unto which divers of them have not willingly consented therefore i will listen diligently and whensoever t hear a murmuring will say unto the people would it not have been better thus behold did i not forewarn thee and so it came to pass that he began to take the servants by the hand and say unto them o that i were made judge in the land that any man having a matter should come to me and i would do him justice nevertheless the people were not minded to hearken to him for this time so that john became chief steward yet during the stewardship of john which was fifty and two moons thomas ceased not to vex the understanding of the multitude and to cause them to find much fault with the conduct of john and the wife of samuel and caused many grievous and sore complaints to be brought against them behold said thomas how mine uncle samuel hath fought in times past against john bull and hath prevailed nevertheless he oweth at this time many talents of silver yet john ceaseth not to build ships and to have bowmen and spearmen not a few and to lay many grievous burthens on the people and crieth out the philistines when no enemy is near and the whole land is in peace and see ye not this woman in whom the heart of mine uncle samuel is bound up how she walketh in the pride of her imagination and hath bought many costly ornaments of silk and of purple and delighteth in hoods and ear rings and bracelets and nose jewels and saith i sit a queen moreover she whispereth in secret and backbiteth and mocketh at all who walk not in her ways and approve not of her evil doings and thus did thomas stir up the minds of the people against john and they waxed wroth against john and they thrust him out of the stewardship and said unto thomas reign thou over us and unto samuel they said the counsel of this woman is not good for she wasteth thy substance lo now put her away and take unto thee the damsel which thomas hath provided for he hath proved her so samuel hearkened unto the people and put away his wife and the thing grieved george sore howbeit he put her away and took the damsel even the woman which thomas had appointed and he went in unto her and she became his wife now thomas had instructed her aforetime and said whenever it shall come to pass that thou shalt rule in the house of samuel whatsoever i shall bid you to do that shalt thou do without gainsaying and she said i will moreover
endangers that is an enemy not to me but to my country not your enemy major asked fleming in a tone of surprize no sir i never had an enemy i lost a hand not in fighting for myself but in defending my country though my sword has tasted blood my feelings and passions had no agency in the act i felt that i was engaged in a duty similar to that in which we are engaged in fighting and subduing our internal spiritual enemies our evil propensities which we are commanded to overcome and destroy though dearer to us than life for as we do the one for the welfare and happiness of the country which protects us so we perform the other for the promotion and extension of our redeemer s kingdom and our share of felicity in each is always proportionate to the uses we perform for both a very strange discrimination and most singular comparison was fleming s remark pray friend enquired brown to what religious sect dost thou belong willoughby again smiled to none sir in religion as in politics i know but one party i am a christian and know of no name under heaven by which man can be saved but that of jesus christ our creator and redeemer but this is again flying from the subject said fleming you say sir that you are an american so are we all by birth or adoption but which of the two administrations do you prefer the federal or republican mr fleming you must consider the question of considerable importance by the earnestness with which you urge it but i consider it of no importance whatever the last fifteen years of my life has been passed in a wilderness i have taken no part in the various questions of policy which have arisen in that period from the loop holes of retreat i have indeed occasionally peeped at mankind and like the poet whose expression i use have sighed for their follies and crimes i have seen two great political parties by turns possess the ascendency and hold the reins of government i entirely approve of neither i have found much to commend but still more to condemn in the measures of both self love and the love of dominion have in my opinion influenced them all and this will continue to be the case until human nature is renovated a singular politician exclaimed fleming as he rose to depart but we will renew the subject at another time mr brown i shall expect you to tea a still more singular christian said the quaker with a smile pray tell me friend how dost thou reconcile the doctrines of christ for whom thou appearest to have a great reverence with thy notions of patriotism and military duties my dear sir replied willoughby there is not a man on earth even the most zealous of your sect that is more fully convinced than i am that all the wars which have ever desolated this fair globe of earth have originated from men s lusts which war in the members the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life are the fuel which evil spirits by blasts from hell too often kindle to an infernal blaze in the hearts of the children of men how then canst thou conscientiously engage in them why sir in my opinion answered the major the true merits of the question must rest upon this point is it lawful to resist the unjust aggressions of wicked men in their mercenary or ambitious attempts to rob us of those inestimable blessings and unalienable rights which nature or rather nature s god has bestowed upon us in order to promote our happiness and the happiness of our posterity trust to god alone answered the quaker and he will protect them for us pardon me replied willoughby would not that be like casting ourselves from the pinnacle of solomon s temple and trusting to god to give his angels charge to bear us up this would be tempting god as the devil wished our saviour to tempt him when he made that proposition not knowing that he was addressing god himself but permit me to illustrate my first position that infernal spirits can only effect their evil designs in this world through the medium or agency of such unhappy mortals as have previously been brought under their wicked influence by passive compliance is a truth which no christian i presume will deny and hence by a transposition as logical as any in algebra the question before us when stripped of all external terms and forms appears to be this is it lawful upon gospel principles to arrest or oppose the movements of infernal spirits in attempting to deprive us of those blessings which a bountiful and gracious providence has bestowed upon us as men or as christians i would answer in the negative said the quaker let every meek just and pious man so oppressed plead rebuke and remonstrate against the impropriety impolicy and injustice of such offenders and to convince and turn the current of public opinion against them which would as it became general sweep gradually their oppressors into the fathomless ocean religion is supernatural and checks self defence but self defence sir is the first law of nature it is a principle implanted in us by god for the preservation of our lives it is this principle which prompts us to extend our hand when falling or to guard off an impending blow or if that is out of our power to disable the hand which is giving it i still think sir that it would be tempting the almighty to remain in either case perfectly passive and trust to him for protection i will grant replied brown that self defence is the first law of nature but those who are united to that which is
